            <p class="secsubtag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
                system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: Central, state and local. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
                Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
                The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in
                Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                legally by each of India’s constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made
                education a ‘concurrent subject’. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal
                responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with 28
                states and eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between states in the
                policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast.

                As per the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2012, 96.5% of all rural children between the ages
                of 6-14 were enrolled in school. This is the fourth annual survey to report enrolment above 96%. India
                has maintained an average enrolment ratio of 95% for students in this age group from year 2007 to 2014.
                As an outcome the number of students in the age group 6-14 who are not enrolled in school has come down
                to 2.8% in the academic year 2018 (ASER 2018).[16] Another report from 2013 stated that there were 229
                million students enrolled in different accredited urban and rural schools of India, from Class I to XII,
                representing an increase of 2.3 million students over 2002 total enrolment, and a 19% increase in girl's
                enrolment.[17] While quantitatively India is inching closer to universal education, the quality of its
                education has been questioned particularly in its government run school system. While more than 95 per
                cent of children attend primary school, just 40 per cent of Indian adolescents attend secondary school
                (Grades 9-12). Since 2000, the World Bank has committed over $2 billion to education in India.

                Secular institutions cropped up along Buddhist monasteries. These institutions imparted practical
                education, e.g. medicine. A number of urban learning centres became increasingly visible from the period
                between 500 BCE to 400 CE. The important urban centers of learning were Nalanda (in modern-day Bihar)
                and Manassa in Nagpur, among others. These institutions systematically imparted knowledge and attracted
                a number of foreign students to study topics such as Buddhist Páli literature, logic, páli grammar, etc.
                Chanakya, a Brahmin teacher, was among the most famous teachers, associated with founding of Mauryan
                Empire.
